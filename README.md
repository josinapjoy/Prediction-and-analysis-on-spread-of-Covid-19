# Prediction-and-analysis-on-spread-of-Covid-19
This project aims to analyze, visualize, perform live data comparisons using Johns Hopkins 
University dataset. Our major activities will comprise of prediction on overall Growth Rate, 
Recovery Rate, and Mortality Rate by using Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average 
(ARIMA) & PROPHET modelling on the number of cumulative cases overtime on virus spread. 
Additionally, perform short-term transmission prediction by the development of a time series 
model. Further, the results to be validated over MAPE, MASE, ACF statistics using R 
programming language.
